## havsim - an open source traffic microsimulator for highways
In the future, I hope to call havsim the first differentiable traffic simulator

# Install
1. Download the repository
2. In command prompt (or equivalent), navigate to the havsim file directory (the folder with setup.py) and run 
```
pip install -e .
```

# Usage
There are many different scripts you can look at, arguably the most useful/interesting is the one in scripts > fall 2020 > bottleneck simulation

# Reference
If this code was useful to your research, please consider citing the associated paper
