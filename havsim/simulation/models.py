   The mobil is a dicretionary/incentive lane changing model, and we use the safety conditions
    proposed by Treiber, Kesting to accompany mobil (see their book (Traffic Flow Dynamics, 2013)).
    We added an original tactical/cooperative model which uses Vehicle's shift_eql method
    to modify the car following acceleration (see coop_tact_model). We also add a probability
    of checking the discretionary model, and a cooldown period after making a discretionary change, during
    which vehicles cannot make another discretionary change.
    We also use the concept of an 'activated' discretionary state, where after meeting their
    incentive criteria, vehicles will always check the LC/tactical/cooperation model (whereas in the
    normal discretionary state, vehicles only have a probability to check the LC model)

    parameters of IDM-
        0 - safety criteria (maximum deceleration allowed after LC, more negative = less strict),
        1 - See the comment block on different possible safety criteria formulations. This is the
            safety criteria for maximum deceleration allowed, when velocity is 0.
        2 - incentive criteria (>0, larger = more strict. smaller = discretionary changes more likely),
        3 - politeness (taking other vehicles into account, 0 = ignore other vehicles, ~.1-.2 = realistic),
        4 - bias on left side (can add a bias to make vehicles default to a certain side of the road),
        5 - bias on right side,
        6 - probability of checking LC while in discretionary state (not in original model. set to 1
            to always check discretionary. units are probability of checking per timestep)
        7 - number of timesteps in cooperative/tactical state after meeting incentive criteria for
            a discretionary change (not in original model)
        8 - number of timesteps after a discretionary change when another discretionary change is not
            possible (not in original model)

    naming convention - 'l/r' = left/right respectively, current lane if no l/r
    'new' indicates that it would be the configuration after potential change
    e.g. newlfolhd = new left follower headway - the headway of the
    left follower if the ego vehicle changed left

    Information on lane changing models -
    There are two types of lane changes, discretionary and mandatory. In a discretionary change, you change
    lanes in order to improve your driving situation, i.e. to change to a faster/more comfortable lane.
    In a mandatory change, you have to change lanes in order to follow your route (e.g. taking an exit or
    merging from on-ramp onto the main road).
    To make a discretionary change, you have to meet an incentive condition as well as a safety condition.
    The incentive condition encodes how beneficial the lane change is to the ego vehicle, and the safety
    condition is a binary decision which states whether or not the lane change will potentially cause a
    collision. To make a mandatory change, only the safety condition must be met.
    In the mobil model, the incentive and safety conditions are based off of the accelerations of
    the vehicles, meaning the car following model is used to determine the safety and incentive conditions.
    The incentive is the difference of ego vehicle's acceleration in the current lane with
    the acceleration in the new lane; the incentive must pass a threshold to trigger a discretionary
    lane change. The safety condition is based off the ego vehicle's acceleration in the new lane and
    the left follower's acceleration in the new lane; both must be above a threshold for the change to be
    considered safe.

    """Cooperative and tactical model for a lane changing decision model.

    Explanation of model -
    first we assume that we can give vehicles one of two commands - accelerate or decelerate. These commands
    cause a vehicle to give more space, or less space, respectively. See any shift_eql function.
    There are three possible options - cooperation and tactical, or only cooperation, or only tactical

    In the tactical model, first we check the safety conditions to see what is preventing us from
    changing (either lcside fol or lcside lead). If only the follower's safety is violated, the vehicle
    accelerates. If the vehicle's own safety is violated; the vehicle decelerates. In the case where both
    safeties are violated, the vehicle accelerates. The tactical model only modifies the acceleration of veh.

    in the cooperative model, we try to identify a cooperating vehicle. A cooperating vehicle gets a
    deceleration added so that it will give extra space to let the ego vehicle successfully change lanes.
    Cooperation is only applied if the lcside fol is blocking the ego vehicle; if only the lcside leader
    is blocking, only the tactical model will be applied.
    If the cooperation is applied without tactical, then the cooperating vehicle must be the lcside follower,
    and the newlcsidefolhd must be > jam spacing. This prevents cooperation with vehicles that are right next
    to you.
    if cooperation is applied with tactical, then in addition to the above, it's also possible the
    cooperating vehicle is the lcside follower's follower, where additionally the newlcsidefolhd is
    < jam spacing, but the headway between the lcside follower's follower and veh is > jam spacing.
    In this case, the lcside follower cannot cooperate, so we allow its follower to cooperate instead.
    In the first case where the cooperating vehicle is the lcside follower, the tactical model is applied
    as normal.
    In the second case, since the issue is the the lcside follower is directly blocking the vehicle,
    the vehicle accelerates if the lcside follower has a slower speed than vehicle, and decelerates otherwise.
    The cooperative model only modifies the acceleration of the cooperating vehicle.

    when a vehicle requests cooperation, it has to additionally fulfill a condition which simulates
    the choice of the cooperating vehicle. All vehicles have a innate probability (coop_parameters attribute)
    of cooperating, and for a discretionary LC, this innate probability controls whether or not the
    cooperation is accepted.
    For a mandatory LC, vehicle can add to this probability, which simulates forcing the cooperation.
    vehicles have a lc_urgency attribute which is updated upon initiating a mandatory change. lc_urgency is a
    tuple of two positions, at the first position, only the follower's innate cooperation probability
    is used. at the second position, the follower is always forced to cooperate, even if it has 0
    innate cooperation probability, and the additional cooperation probability is interpolated linearally
    between these two positions.

    Implementation details -
    vehicles also have a coop_veh attribute which stores the cooperating vehicle. A cooperating
    vehicle does not have any attribute marking it as such. A vehicle's shift_eql method is what is
    used to widen/shrink gaps to allow lane changing.
