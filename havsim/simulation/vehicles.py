class Vehicle:
    """Base Vehicle class. Implemented for a second order ODE car following model.

    Vehicles are responsible for implementing the rules to update their positions. This includes a
    'car following' (cf) model which is used to update the longitudinal (in the direction of travel) position.
    There is also a 'lane changing' (lc) model which is used to update the latitudinal (which lane) position.
    Besides these two fundamental components, Vehicles also need an update method, which updates their
    longitudinal positions and memory of their past (past memory includes any quantities which are needed
    to differentiate the simulation).
    Vehicles also contain the quantities lead, fol, lfol, rfol, llead, and rlead, (i.e. their vehicle
    relationships) which define the order of vehicles on the road, and is necessary for calling the cf
    and lc models.
    Vehicles also maintain a route, which defines what roads they want to travel on in the road network.
    Besides their actual lc model, Vehicles also handle any additional components of lane changing,
    such as relaxation, cooperation, or tactical lane changing models.
    Lastly, the vehicle class has some methods which may be used for certain boundary conditions.
