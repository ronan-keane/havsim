        Args:
            inputs: list of lead_inputs, cur_state, hidden_states.
                lead_inputs - tensor with shape (nveh, nt, 2), giving the leader position and speed at
                    each timestep.
                cur_state -  tensor with shape (nveh, 2) giving the vehicle position and speed at the
                    starting timestep.
                hidden_states - list of the two hidden states, each hidden state is a tensor with shape
                    of (nveh, lstm_units). Initialized as all zeros for the first timestep.
            training: Whether to run in training or inference mode. Need to pass training=True if training
                with dropout.

        Returns:
            outputs: tensor of vehicle positions, shape of (number of vehicles, number of timesteps). Note
                that these are 1 timestep after lead_inputs. E.g. if nt = 2 and lead_inputs has the lead
                measurements for time 0 and 1. Then cur_state has the vehicle position/speed for time 0, and
                outputs has the vehicle positions for time 1 and 2. curspeed would have the speed for time 2,
                and you can differentiate the outputs to get the speed at time 1 if it's needed.
            curspeed: tensor of current vehicle speeds, shape of (number of vehicles, 1)
            hidden_states: last hidden states for LSTM. Tuple of tensors, where each tensor has shape of
                (number of vehicles, number of LSTM units)
